# Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Course. The goal of the project is to analyze short text messages in the scope of disaster response. Different needs like missing water or electricity should be categorized to get a better view on the disaster and to perform appropriate measurements.

# Installation

All the files were created using Jupyter Lab and the Python programming language (version 3.8.8). The following Pyhton libraries were used:
- os
- pandas 1.2.4
- seaborn 0.11.1
